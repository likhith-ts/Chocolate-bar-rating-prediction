# Chocolate-bar-rating-prediction
This was the major project that I worked with during my first intership, this project comes under Data Science and Machine Learning Domain.<br>

Aim:
To predict the ratings of chocolate bars of different chocolate stores in different locations.
<br>

Description:
Performed EDA and removed nan values and outliers.<br>
Neural Network used: ANN dense model using tensorflow.keras.model module<br>
Optimization algorithm used: RMSprop<br>
activation function used: relu<br>
loss function used: mse<br>
Normalized the non numeric categorical data using One-Hot encoding to avoid errors during training of sequential neural network model.<br>
note: Not yet developed web application and deployed on cloud.<br>
